**ASSIGNMENT**

For this assignment, read more about the different strategies available for authenticating with Passport. Pick a strategy to study and write a high-level explanation of how it works. This explanation does not need to be technical.

ANSWER: The Passport-Spotify strategy for authenticating Node.js applications that support middleware like Express or Connect.  These frameworks help combine "middleware" to handle requests. Passport utilizes the users Spotify account and OAuth 2.0 tokens to authenticate the user.  The application will take a user action and a GET request to 
/authorize with a Spotify profile.  Once the the application is registered Spotify will provide a Client ID.  Once the user grants or denies permission the user will be sent to specific Redirect URI, if the user does grant access an authorization code will be used to exchange for an access token. Spotify exchanges the code for a token after receiving a POST request.   The token will be sent in the body of the POST request it has to contain the parameters encoded in 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.  OAuth 2.O requires the following parameters: `grant_type` - must contain the value "authorization_code", `code`- the authorization returned from the initial request., `redirect_uri` and `authorization`- base 64 encoded string that includes client ID and secret key. Access tokens are purposefully set to expire after a short time, but the users can request new tokens by exchanging the original token received.
